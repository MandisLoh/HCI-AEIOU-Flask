SUTDReviews --- Sharing reviews on SUTD Mods,"Hey SUTDFam!!

 

Having trouble deciding what mods to take?  Want to find out more from those who have taken it before?

 

Fret not! A few SUTD seniors came together to create SUTDreviews <https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsutdreviews.com%2F&data=04%7C01%7C_chua%40mymail.sutd.edu.sg%7Cf87193deeb3441d742f008d95585ab72%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637634854955512018%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=Q7DNYDp2LVZqKqB4l1kpp1vEjvEodR3pbnQQgrL%2Bh64%3D&reserved=0> !

"
Change of Name for the ISTD Degree Programme," Students,

 

SUTD will be changing the name of its degree programme from the Bachelor of Engineering (Information Systems Technology and Design) to Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Science and Design). This name change will take effect from the graduating class of 2021 and will also affect the Minor programme. 

 

The decision to change the programme name to “Computer Science and Design (CSD)” aims to accurately reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the computing-intensive coupled with design curriculum that students have undergone in the ISTD pillar. Multiple discussions with various stakeholders such as alumni, current students, faculty and industry also highlighted strong reasons in support of this change.

 

In a survey of 177 participants from the stakeholder groups, 83% of them were in favour of renaming it “Computer Science and Design (CSD)”.

The curriculum of the CSD degree programme will remain essentially unchanged and is still accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Board (EAB). 

ISTD will continue to retain its pillar name at the Pillar level as it extensively covers general topics related to information systems and computer science.

 

Thank you for your attention.

 

Your sincerely,

Tony

Hi Sumbul,

 

Thank you for the update.

 

Firstly, regarding copyright page – yes, the authors should maintain the copyright of their stories. Regarding the wording of the same on the page, among others points, we are not too sure about it. I am attaching a version here where we have done some amendments to the copyright page and the preface but would request you to please get it vet from someone in your team who is qualified to verify the language for the copyright page. 

 

Secondly, I am attaching two documents, one for the cover page and one for the section divider page (pagination page for the stories) for you to adapt. Am attaching them in both word and in pdf for you to be able to visualize how it will look. For the Section Divider, I would recommend to keep the visual elements as well.

 

Thirdly, regarding your other requests/doubts, I have created a doc which am attaching here as a reference guide for team.

 

I hope the details will be clear and if not, please do let me know!

 

Thanks,

Parul

Hello Parul, Sheena,

 

Just to update you, we have received confirmations from close to 75 people. Around 10 people haven't responded to the email, we are reaching out to them separately through their institutes. 

 

We have also incorporated the changes suggested by the contributors and DSg. 

 

The following issues remain: 

1.	Please help us with a template/ brand guide/ sample heading styles as requested below. We need this so we can implement the changes quickly as desired by DSg, and avoid unnecessary back and forth over font styles. 
2.	Please confirm if authors would retain copyright to their stories. 

Thanks

Sumbul

Hello Parul, Sheena

 

Could you please confirm that authors will retain copyright to their stories? 

 

My understanding from conference proceedings is that authors retain copyright. 

 

Thanks

Hi Parul, Sheena

 

Great speaking to you. I have attached a Word file of the Ebook. 

 

Here's my understanding of the decisions & requests for samples, which would help us in quickly implementing the changes: 

*	All changes in Preface & front matter: I have attached the word file with the preface and front matter. Please feel free to make requisite edits.  
*	Please use a high-res Dsg logo: Please help us with a high-res Dsg logo 
*	I had recommended a Cover Page/ an Illustration for the  E-book. Can it still be explored? Please help us with a Word editable version of the Cover page. 
*	Subheads within stories should be sentence-cased. Please help us with a sample. 
*	All titles should be initial caps. Please help us with a sample. 
*	Images within the same story, if possible, should ideally be of the same dimensions, especially if they’re placed side by side; images should also align with column widths as much as possible. We can try to adjust the images a bit, but can't promise, as the original images might have underlying issues. We will crop/ adjust wherever possible. Please help us with the new images that you mentioned. 
*	Remove all image credits (should be quite self-explanatory that the images originated from the respective sources/authors); You can either change “Figure” to “Image” if they are “Images” and  drawings or illustrations be “Figure”. However, you can also remove all the “Figure 1”, “Figure 2” etc at the start of each caption as it’s obvious the captions are for the accompanying photos. OK, please help us with the sentence you want for image credits. 
*	Having pull-out quotes is good – suggest to have them in all stories to break the monotony (especially so for those stories without any photos). We agreed that we will keep current pagination & layout (pull out quotes in all stories will lead to spill over). 
*	A lot of the photos appear at the end of each story which isn’t ideal. Would it be possible to better feature them earlier on in the story, e.g. when it’s first mentioned, so readers can reference to them and it makes for a more engaging story, instead of just text. We will try to accommodate as much as possible. 
*	Also, we would like to propose a joint ownership i.e. both SUTD and Dsg for the E-book as per https://www.artsresourcehub.gov.sg/legal-support/intellectual-property-copyright#:~:text=In%20joint%20copyright%20ownership%2C%20each,creation%20of%20this%20joint%20work <https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.artsresourcehub.gov.sg%2Flegal-support%2Fintellectual-property-copyright%23%3A~%3Atext%3DIn%2520joint%2520copyright%2520ownership%252C%2520each%2Ccreation%2520of%2520this%2520joint%2520work&data=04%7C01%7C_chua%40mymail.sutd.edu.sg%7C19c1107836f14ea2cdc208d952706da6%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637631465898902569%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=O64TIj4cTfLkeSczoEf8mX02FNb95SU7n4hOmzNaP94%3D&reserved=0> . Please help us with the sentence you'd like us to insert in the copyright page. 
	
	
*	We will go with the map that we currently have as it is based on DSg template. 
*	QR codes have been used as 'fillers' in white space, we will create links wherever possible. 
*	We will update TOC for greater readability. 
*	
	
	

1.	Best
2.	Sumbul

Hi Sumbul,

 

We have gone through the PDF and collated our comments. Most of them have been added within the doc itself but sharing some over-arching points here as well. Also, will SUTD be proof-reading the stories once the contributors confirm and give their consent as well. We too of course will be doing with the same.

 

Here are some pointers:

*	All copy should be British spelling; spell out one to nine
*	Subheads within stories should be sentence-cased
*	All titles should be initial caps
*	Images within the same story, if possible, should ideally be of the same dimensions, especially if they’re placed side by side; images should also align with column widths as much as possible
*	Remove all image credits (should be quite self-explanatory that the images originated from the respective sources/authors); You can either change “Figure” to “Image” if they are “Images” and  drawings or illustrations be “Figure”. However, you can also remove all the “Figure 1”, “Figure 2” etc at the start of each caption as it’s obvious the captions are for the accompanying photos
*	Having pull-out quotes is good – suggest to have them in all stories to break the monotony (especially so for those stories without any photos)
*	A lot of the photos appear at the end of each story which isn’t ideal. Would it be possible to better feature them earlier on in the story, e.g. when it’s first mentioned, so readers can reference to them and it makes for a more engaging story, instead of just text.

Hi there,

 

I’d like to suggest that you add a liner to address the distribution of the e-book.

Hi Sumbul,

 

Thank you for the draft. We are in principle ok but do have a few suggestions on some of the details. We are still collating them from a couple of our team members. However, we are not yet proof reading the stories. We would like to do that post you sharing and having received back the proofs from the contributors. Hence, if you want to proceed with that you may and I will also send our comments before the end of this week.

 

Once you have received the proofs from the contributors, we can go through it again for final approval.

 

Let me know your thoughts.

 

Thank you,

Parul

Hi Manson,

 

Apologies for this delay. I unfortunately do not have a raw file for this image but I do have a full png. I would request if you could use this as a template/ reference to make a fresh map visual for the e-book.

 Parul, 

 

For the compilation PDF for Call for Stories, there is a requirement to put a world map into the PDF. Is it possible if we can get a copy of this world map as shown in the screenshot from DSG side without the “register now” red circle? 

 

Hope to hear from you soon!

Revised  Student Exco and Cohort Advisor  programmes," Student Reps,

 

Thank you for your commitment and contributions serving as Student Exco members over the past Term 1 and 2. We hope you have an enjoyable and  enriching experience in taking up the student leadership position in SUTD . 

 

With the adoption of the new academic calendar in which Freshmore Term 1 and Term 3 are overlapped in the Fall Term, and the regrouping of the Freshmore Term 3 students into new different cohorts according to your choice of the elective subjects under the new Freshmore curriculum, it is necessary to make certain revisions on the Student Exco Programme and Freshmore Cohort Advisor Programme accordingly to better adapt to these changes without compromising to your learning experience and growth during your Freshmore journey.

 

Revisions of Student Exco and Cohort Advisor programmes for Term 3 effective from Sept 2021:

 

1.       Cohort Advisor will serve only the first two terms, i.e. Term 1 and Term 2, not in Term 3.

 

2.       Student Exco of each cohort group will only be formed in Term 1 and Term 2, not in Term 3.

In Term 3, Office of Undergraduate Studies (UGS) will work with you to identify 2 to 3 student reps from each new cohort group, either by nomination or self-nomination, to manage the cohort classroom facilities and resources, such as the library books, AV system, stationery and etc, and UGS will take care of the Freshmore Term 3 students’ welfare in the areas of cohort classroom logistics matters.

 

3.	Keep the Best Class Spirit Award of $300 to be awarded after Term 2.

 

4.       Retain the cohort funding of $250 in Term 3. Funding utilization is subject to the UGS approval.

 

5.	Discontinue the Cleanest Cohort Classroom Award in Term 3.

 

6.	Discontinue the Cohort Classroom Design Competition.

 

 

Thanks.

Best regards

Lim Bee Foong

Manager, Office of Undergraduate Studies

Hi ,

Thank you for looking into this program! I've taken note of the tentative dates from 20-24 December 2021, we can finalise the date when more details are being firmed up.

The P3 & P4 class size is 21 pax & 13 pax respectively. On our end, we are alright for the on-site engagement to still carry on with this age group, though unvaccinated. 
Thank you for giving us the assurance that your team will be fully vaccinated by then!

Looking at the current cases & safe distancing measures, it is good to have an online schedule planned out like what your team initiated. 
In view of that, may I please suggest that your team propose a cut-off date for us to make a decision on whether we should proceed with an on-site or online program regardless of future changes in the safe distancing measures? This is to ensure that there is sufficient time for both parties adjust the program & getting the attendance of the children.

The general safe distancing measures that we have in our centre as of now a

- No more than 5 pax per group for activities/discussion, including students & volunteers
- Classes of different levels are not allowed to mingle 
- To try our best to maintain 1 metre distance between individuals & groups 

As the detailed safe distancing measures may change frequently, above are some basic general guidelines for us to follow. If there is anything else to add on along the way, I will keep you updated. Hope this clarifies!

Please feel free to contact me if more clarification is needed! Thank you.

Hi Geraldine,  

 

That’s some really great news! Looking forward to working with your team.  

 

After much discussion with my team, we are likely to organize the program on either of these dates, 20-24 December 2021, after our finals examination. In addition, we are looking into designing the program for P3 and/or P4 students. A query we have would be that is it possible to plan activities for this age group, as they cannot be vaccinated? If possible, may we know the cohort size for P3 and P4 respectively? If it’s not encouraged, would changing our target group to above 12 years old be more suitable? On our side, please rest assured that my team will be fully vaccinated by then.  

 

As much as we love to organize an on-site activity, we would plan an online schedule as well in case of any sudden wave of infection (touchwood!). Is it possible to share with us some safe management measures that you observe so that we can include similar measures in the proposal?  

 

Thank you so much and hope to hear from you soon!  

 

Have a great day!

 ,

Thank you for expressing your interest in partnering Bethesda Care Services, Sunshine Club Student Care Centre! We are glad to hear from you on the potential volunteering opportunity, and we are definitely keen to partner with you be it on-site or online in accordance to the safe management measures.


The idea of blending Christmas with being environmentally friendly sounds great, with a mix of fun and interactive activities.


For a start, our centre consists of approximately 100 children, ranging from P1 to Sec 2, age 7 to 14 years old. We have 6 staff-in-charge for the respective classes. May I please ask if there is a specific age group you are looking at?


I understand that there are no fixed plans as of now as it is still quite some time away from Christmas. We can discuss along the way when more ideas are generated!

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you've further queries.

Hi Parul, Sheena

 

Great speaking to you. I have attached a Word file of the Ebook. 

 

Here's my understanding of the decisions & requests for samples, which would help us in quickly implementing the changes: 

*	All changes in Preface & front matter: I have attached the word file with the preface and front matter. Please feel free to make requisite edits.  
*	Please use a high-res Dsg logo: Please help us with a high-res Dsg logo 
*	I had recommended a Cover Page/ an Illustration for the  E-book. Can it still be explored? Please help us with a Word editable version of the Cover page. 
*	Subheads within stories should be sentence-cased. Please help us with a sample. 
*	All titles should be initial caps. Please help us with a sample. 
*	Images within the same story, if possible, should ideally be of the same dimensions, especially if they’re placed side by side; images should also align with column widths as much as possible. We can try to adjust the images a bit, but can't promise, as the original images might have underlying issues. We will crop/ adjust wherever possible. Please help us with the new images that you mentioned. 
*	Remove all image credits (should be quite self-explanatory that the images originated from the respective sources/authors); You can either change “Figure” to “Image” if they are “Images” and  drawings or illustrations be “Figure”. However, you can also remove all the “Figure 1”, “Figure 2” etc at the start of each caption as it’s obvious the captions are for the accompanying photos. OK, please help us with the sentence you want for image credits. 
*	Having pull-out quotes is good – suggest to have them in all stories to break the monotony (especially so for those stories without any photos). We agreed that we will keep current pagination & layout (pull out quotes in all stories will lead to spill over). 
*	A lot of the photos appear at the end of each story which isn’t ideal. Would it be possible to better feature them earlier on in the story, e.g. when it’s first mentioned, so readers can reference to them and it makes for a more engaging story, instead of just text. We will try to accommodate as much as possible. 
*	Also, we would like to propose a joint ownership i.e. both SUTD and Dsg for the E-book as per https://www.artsresourcehub.gov.sg/legal-support/intellectual-property-copyright#:~:text=In%20joint%20copyright%20ownership%2C%20each,creation%20of%20this%20joint%20work <https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.artsresourcehub.gov.sg%2Flegal-support%2Fintellectual-property-copyright%23%3A~%3Atext%3DIn%2520joint%2520copyright%2520ownership%252C%2520each%2Ccreation%2520of%2520this%2520joint%2520work&data=04%7C01%7C_chua%40mymail.sutd.edu.sg%7C153f43f0145d4d7f7fcb08d94c57e5ab%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637624762985274120%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=Bgcnhe3C7b8B%2BMaoD%2F4XBXkajGYNRJUBcpskRtMLSeQ%3D&reserved=0> . Please help us with the sentence you'd like us to insert in the copyright page. 
*	We will go with the map that we currently have as it is based on DSg template. 
*	QR codes have been used as 'fillers' in white space, we will create links wherever possible. 
*	We will update TOC for greater readability. 
*	 

1.	Best

Hi Sumbul,

 

We have gone through the PDF and collated our comments. Most of them have been added within the doc itself but sharing some over-arching points here as well. Also, will SUTD be proof-reading the stories once the contributors confirm and give their consent as well. We too of course will be doing with the same.

 

Here are some pointers:

*	All copy should be British spelling; spell out one to nine
*	Subheads within stories should be sentence-cased
*	All titles should be initial caps
*	Images within the same story, if possible, should ideally be of the same dimensions, especially if they’re placed side by side; images should also align with column widths as much as possible
*	Remove all image credits (should be quite self-explanatory that the images originated from the respective sources/authors); You can either change “Figure” to “Image” if they are “Images” and  drawings or illustrations be “Figure”. However, you can also remove all the “Figure 1”, “Figure 2” etc at the start of each caption as it’s obvious the captions are for the accompanying photos
*	Having pull-out quotes is good – suggest to have them in all stories to break the monotony (especially so for those stories without any photos)
*	A lot of the photos appear at the end of each story which isn’t ideal. Would it be possible to better feature them earlier on in the story, e.g. when it’s first mentioned, so readers can reference to them and it makes for a more engaging story, instead of just text.

Hi there,

 

I’d like to suggest that you add a liner to address the distribution of the e-book.

We could mention that the e-book would be placed at the Dsg website after it is complete?

Hi Parul, 

 

Great, thanks! 

*	We will proceed with emailing the contributors and will send you a copy of the mail + google form to collect proofs, for your reference. 
*	Just so you know, we are a bit tight on manpower again as two of our interns have left. We will take care of the most pressing issues in the eBook. 
*	We are checking internally about getting an ISBN number. 

Best

Hi Sumbul,

 

Thank you for the draft. We are in principle ok but do have a few suggestions on some of the details. We are still collating them from a couple of our team members. However, we are not yet proof reading the stories. We would like to do that post you sharing and having received back the proofs from the contributors. Hence, if you want to proceed with that you may and I will also send our comments before the end of this week.

 

Once you have received the proofs from the contributors, we can go through it again for final approval.

 

Let me know your thoughts.

 

Thank you,

Parul

Hello Parul, Sheena, Joanne

 

I am pleased to attach the current draft of the Call for Stories Ebook. 

*	Stories have been basic grammar checked, proof-read, and adjusted to fit in the template. 
*	We have edited some stories (largely the student stories, and those from overseas) to improve the coherence. 
*	We have removed three stories, as those were invalid entries. 
*	We have adapted the Preface sent by DSg. 

We need the following from you:

1.	List of DSg personnel to be included in the acknowledgements page
2.	Input into the ""Copyright"" page. 

Best, 

Sumbul

Apologies for this delay. I unfortunately do not have a raw file for this image but I do have a full png. I would request if you could use this as a template/ reference to make a fresh map visual for the e-book.

 Parul, 

 

For the compilation PDF for Call for Stories, there is a requirement to put a world map into the PDF. Is it possible if we can get a copy of this world map as shown in the screenshot from DSG side without the “register now” red circle? 

 

Hope to hear from you soon!

Apologies for the late reply, your email somehow went buried amongst the rest of them in my inbox 😊. Sure, thanks for your initial interest in this UROP. Your summary is pretty decent, probably it would benefit from more details and more in-depth analyses. Nevertheless, it was a good job.

 

Thanks and all the best!

 

Quin

Hi Quin,

 

Really sorry for the late email, as well as submission.

 

I’ve attached the summary I’ve written for the given research paper. 

 

After much consideration, I decide to give this valuable opportunity a miss. However, it would be a bonus if I could hear from you on what could be improved on the summary for future improvements. 

 

Hope to be able to work with you in the future instead and see you around in school!

 

Stay safe 🙂

 

Yours sincerely,

 Chua

Hi Quin,

 

Thanks for the insightful sharing as well! Sure, I'll submit the summary for the article.

 

However, as I'm currently finishing up my Somerset Belt Installation project, is it possible to submit by the end of Friday instead? The project will end on Thursday when we assemble at the site. I'll be free once this project completes.

 

Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

 Chua

Thank you for taking the time to have a little chat with us today regarding your UROP application. As the UROP demands the ability of the student to read and distill key findings of journal articles (and possible book articles), we would like to have a quick understanding of your propensity to undertake the task. I’ve attached a brief article on entrepreneurial traits. Could you kindly read the article and submit to me an approximately 500-word summary of it by the end of Thursday 13 May? The summary should include an introduction, methods, results, discussion/conclusion, and your brief critical analysis of the article.

 

Please feel free to ask me any questions that you may have.  Look forward to receiving your summary soon!

 

Thanks!

 

Best regards,

Quin

Congrats on winning 1st in the Work category! :) Also, paiseh for this delayed reply. 

 

After looking through the projects, I was thinking if we can organise the projects into 3 different IG posts, Work, Play and Live. 

 

I’ve drafted the social media post for the Play projects. If you’re okay with this approach, I’ll draft up the social media posts for the other 2 categories. I can put up the Play IG post this Sunday, and the other 2 posts early next week. :)

	Hello! 

	First of all, I would like to apologize sincerely for sending this application late as I was considering really thoroughly. After much thought, I decided that I would like to join this program and thus applying for it, which links me to the first question. Hope you would still give this application a read, thank you!

	1.Why do you want to join the program? (Max 100 words) 
	14 months ago, I was hesitating between SMU Business and SUTD. Though coming into SUTD is a great decision, there's still some regret in me for not studying business. As such, I'm intending to pursue a business-related Masters's instead. Filled with lots of great resources, like mentorship and the opportunity to work on case studies, this program is one step closer to my dream and fulfilling it earlier. So, why not? University to me is about self-exploration and preparing me for the real world ahead. I genuinely hope to be enrolled in this to enrich my learning journey in SUTD. 

	2.What career do you wish to pursue? (Max 100 words)
	
	To be very truthful, I don't have a specific answer as I'm not sure what lies ahead of me. However, the concept of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data attracts me and I'm intending to pursue a degree in DAI or ESD. Subsequently, I may find a career related to Business analytic, AI-related developer, or designer. Once, I read about specialists vs generalists. Greedy as I am, I wish for myself to be a 'T-shaped' person, one filled with the breadth of knowledge and depth of expertise. On top of learning new skills, I wish to be enrolled in this program.

	Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to read this and hope to hear from you soon 🙂

 Sharing of Freshmore Experience on SMT Newsletter," ,

 

How are you and so happy to hear from you! 

 

I would be delighted for you to share your experience as a Freshmore student, can be anything really. Highlighted events, what you enjoy most in the first two terms (subject wise, the curriculum, SMT subject, schooling in the pandemic period etc, just some suggestion) and of course you can dedicate your words to F05 as well. 

 

Choose any style or format you want to present, the choice is yours :) The word limit is just an indication of how much we can fit into one page and send me the original photos, as many that you think can fit into one page including caption. We will revise your article on our side after your submission for your review as well. 

 

Feel free to email me if you have any further questions :)

 

Thank you once again and look forward to receive your article.

 Sharing of Freshmore Experience on SMT Newsletter

 

Hi Eng Ying! 

 

Joseph shared with me regarding the SMT Newsletter, and I would love to be part of it! As the class will be split based on electives in Term 3, I was thinking of an article dedicating to F05 before we proceed to our new classes. However, I’m not sure if this topic would be possible. I could write about my Freshmore experience in general if you would prefer that as well. 

 

In addition, I saw the previous newsletter and noticed that some articles wrote from the 3rd POV while some used the Q&A method. Which kind of style should I be using? Apart from the 300 word limit, are there other restrictions like number of images and number of points I should be mentioning?

 

Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

 Chua

Hence, Freshmore students will be assigned a group and a seat number in your respective Cohort Classroom. Please minimise your interactions by working within a fixed group of no more than 5 persons and occupying the assigned seat for lessons. More information on the assigned seating arrangement will be conveyed to freshmore students between 8 and 10 September 2021.

4)    The university would need to keep records of students’ seating arrangements (e.g. Faculty taking photos at the start/end of sessions) to allow affected students to be identified quickly in the event of a confirmed case and for subsequent contact tracing.

5)    Once the class instructions and related academic activities are over for the day, please do not loiter around the classroom. For those who are hostel residents, please return to the hostel; for the rest, please leave campus as soon as possible.

6)    Please observe personal and environmental hygiene with regular hand washing.

 

(V) Consumption of food

 

1)    Meals can only be consumed at the designated refreshment areas only (Canteen, F&B outlets etc) and should not be at student spaces and common areas. Individuals are to mask up immediately after eating, and leave the designated refreshment areas after finishing your meals.

2)    Please clear your table after the meal.

 

As these measures are to ensure the safety and wellbeing of everyone, compliance is mandatory.  Disciplinary actions will be taken against the student(s) for any violation.

  Action Required: Concur Expense Claim Pending Your Approval

 

 Sea Ming,

 

Sorry for the delayed response as I’ve been really busy these days. Please do understand me for not being able to give immediate response.

 

The problem I’m facing here is that DBS statement comes out every second week of the month, which means my payment on 12 August will only be displayed in the September statement, which I don’t have it now. I’ve tried to find ways to request but to no avail. Please do advice me accordingly on this. 

 

My sister has recommended me to show that the bank account is indeed mine by attaching my previous bank statement. Thus, you’ll have the purchase record, my name and bank account. 

 

Hope this is good and I will resubmit on concur. 

 

Also, due to the inclusiveness of GST and higher conversion rate, my claimed amount ($80.88) is higher than the request amount $73+, which I obtained by just converting USD53 to SGD. Hope you could return me $80.88 instead.

 

Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

 Chua

		Hello! 

		First of all, I would like to apologize sincerely for sending this application late as I was considering really thoroughly. After much thought, I decided that I would like to join this program and thus applying for it, which links me to the first question. Hope you would still give this application a read, thank you!

		1.Why do you want to join the program? (Max 100 words) 
		14 months ago, I was hesitating between SMU Business and SUTD. Though coming into SUTD is a great decision, there's still some regret in me for not studying business. As such, I'm intending to pursue a business-related Masters's instead. Filled with lots of great resources, like mentorship and the opportunity to work on case studies, this program is one step closer to my dream and fulfilling it earlier. So, why not? University to me is about self-exploration and preparing me for the real world ahead. I genuinely hope to be enrolled in this to enrich my learning journey in SUTD. 

		2.What career do you wish to pursue? (Max 100 words)
		
		To be very truthful, I don't have a specific answer as I'm not sure what lies ahead of me. However, the concept of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data attracts me and I'm intending to pursue a degree in DAI or ESD. Subsequently, I may find a career related to Business analytic, AI-related developer, or designer. Once, I read about specialists vs generalists. Greedy as I am, I wish for myself to be a 'T-shaped' person, one filled with the breadth of knowledge and depth of expertise. On top of learning new skills, I wish to be enrolled in this program.

		Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to read this and hope to hear from you soon 🙂
		
		
		Yours sincerely,

			Hello! 

			 

			First of all, I would like to apologize sincerely for sending this application late as I was considering really thoroughly. After much thought, I decided that I would like to join this program and thus applying for it, which links me to the first question. Hope you would still give this application a read, thank you!

			 

			1.Why do you want to join the program? (Max 100 words) 

			14 months ago, I was hesitating between SMU Business and SUTD. Though coming into SUTD is a great decision, there's still some regret in me for not studying business. As such, I'm intending to pursue a business-related Masters's instead. Filled with lots of great resources, like mentorship and the opportunity to work on case studies, this program is one step closer to my dream and fulfilling it earlier. So, why not? University to me is about self-exploration and preparing me for the real world ahead. I genuinely hope to be enrolled in this to enrich my learning journey in SUTD. 

			 

			2.What career do you wish to pursue? (Max 100 words)

			To be very truthful, I don't have a specific answer as I'm not sure what lies ahead of me. However, the concept of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data attracts me and I'm intending to pursue a degree in DAI or ESD. Subsequently, I may find a career related to Business analytic, AI-related developer, or designer. Once, I read about specialists vs generalists. Greedy as I am, I wish for myself to be a 'T-shaped' person, one filled with the breadth of knowledge and depth of expertise. On top of learning new skills, I wish to be enrolled in this program.

			 

			Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to read this and hope to hear from you soon 🙂

			 

			Yours sincerely, 

			 Chua

Hooray! You guys are the best class and congratulations on winning the best class spirit award and thank you on behalf of the class for writing up the submission :) And I think your article came at the perfect timing to commemorate F05. The video is so cute, love seeing everyone faces there. 

 

I sincerely appreciate your time in writing up the article. For you information, SMT is a cluster consist most of the Freshmore subjects as well as few minor program in the upper year too. Unfortunately for the first 2 term, 3.007 course is not part of SMT. I include the link here for your reference: https://smt.sutd.edu.sg/education/undergraduate/courses/. Since your article will be published in SMT newsletter, I thought it will be nice (if any) to showcase any SMT relevant subjects or faculty too? This is just my opinion so that your experience is share at the right platform. I will help you check if your message to 3.007 course and faculty could be publish in another newsletter. I am sure they will be more than happy to have your experience share there too. Let me know if that is ok with you. 

 

Please let me know if you have any other query, will try my best to response to you promptly.

 

Thank you so much

How are you and so happy to hear from you! 

 

I would be delighted for you to share your experience as a Freshmore student, can be anything really. Highlighted events, what you enjoy most in the first two terms (subject wise, the curriculum, SMT subject, schooling in the pandemic period etc, just some suggestion) and of course you can dedicate your words to F05 as well. 

 

Choose any style or format you want to present, the choice is yours :) The word limit is just an indication of how much we can fit into one page and send me the original photos, as many that you think can fit into one page including caption. We will revise your article on our side after your submission for your review as well. 

 

Feel free to email me if you have any further questions :)

 

Thank you once again and look forward to receive your article.

 Sharing of Freshmore Experience on SMT Newsletter

 

Hi Eng Ying! 

 

Joseph shared with me regarding the SMT Newsletter, and I would love to be part of it! As the class will be split based on electives in Term 3, I was thinking of an article dedicating to F05 before we proceed to our new classes. However, I’m not sure if this topic would be possible. I could write about my Freshmore experience in general if you would prefer that as well. 

 

In addition, I saw the previous newsletter and noticed that some articles wrote from the 3rd POV while some used the Q&A method. Which kind of style should I be using? Apart from the 300 word limit, are there other restrictions like number of images and number of points I should be mentioning?

 

Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

 Chua

				Hello! 

				 

				First of all, I would like to apologize sincerely for sending this application late as I was considering really thoroughly. After much thought, I decided that I would like to join this program and thus applying for it, which links me to the first question. Hope you would still give this application a read, thank you!

				 

				1.Why do you want to join the program? (Max 100 words) 

				14 months ago, I was hesitating between SMU Business and SUTD. Though coming into SUTD is a great decision, there's still some regret in me for not studying business. As such, I'm intending to pursue a business-related Masters's instead. Filled with lots of great resources, like mentorship and the opportunity to work on case studies, this program is one step closer to my dream and fulfilling it earlier. So, why not? University to me is about self-exploration and preparing me for the real world ahead. I genuinely hope to be enrolled in this to enrich my learning journey in SUTD. 

				 

				2.What career do you wish to pursue? (Max 100 words)

				To be very truthful, I don't have a specific answer as I'm not sure what lies ahead of me. However, the concept of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data attracts me and I'm intending to pursue a degree in DAI or ESD. Subsequently, I may find a career related to Business analytic, AI-related developer, or designer. Once, I read about specialists vs generalists. Greedy as I am, I wish for myself to be a 'T-shaped' person, one filled with the breadth of knowledge and depth of expertise. On top of learning new skills, I wish to be enrolled in this program.

				 

				Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to read this and hope to hear from you soon 🙂

				 

				Yours sincerely, 

				 Chua

We would require assistance to record whenever the teams are in Breakout Rooms. The Zoom recordings do take a while to convert if the recording is too long, so a suggestion would be to stop the recording during your lunch/dinner breaks and resume recording during the discussions.

 

I will be recording the main Zoom room lectures, hence you are not required to record during those times.

 

Do feel free to let me know if there are any issues accessing the link, or if there are any questions. I must apologize that there has been some hiccups/last min changes today as we started Day 1 of this virtual programme.. I hope everyone is able to have fun and enjoy the rest of the programme in the next 3 days. 😊

For the caption of the video, I think ""F05 best class!"" if it's informal. If it's formal, I think ""Scan to watch some fun moments of F05"".

Hooray! You guys are the best class and congratulations on winning the best class spirit award and thank you on behalf of the class for writing up the submission :) And I think your article came at the perfect timing to commemorate F05. The video is so cute, love seeing everyone faces there. 

 

I sincerely appreciate your time in writing up the article. For you information, SMT is a cluster consist most of the Freshmore subjects as well as few minor program in the upper year too. Unfortunately for the first 2 term, 3.007 course is not part of SMT. I include the link here for your reference: https://smt.sutd.edu.sg/education/undergraduate/courses/. Since your article will be published in SMT newsletter, I thought it will be nice (if any) to showcase any SMT relevant subjects or faculty too? This is just my opinion so that your experience is share at the right platform. I will help you check if your message to 3.007 course and faculty could be publish in another newsletter. I am sure they will be more than happy to have your experience share there too. Let me know if that is ok with you. 

 

Please let me know if you have any other query, will try my best to response to you promptly.

How are you and so happy to hear from you! 

 

I would be delighted for you to share your experience as a Freshmore student, can be anything really. Highlighted events, what you enjoy most in the first two terms (subject wise, the curriculum, SMT subject, schooling in the pandemic period etc, just some suggestion) and of course you can dedicate your words to F05 as well. 

 

Choose any style or format you want to present, the choice is yours :) The word limit is just an indication of how much we can fit into one page and send me the original photos, as many that you think can fit into one page including caption. We will revise your article on our side after your submission for your review as well.

 Sharing of Freshmore Experience on SMT Newsletter

 

Hi Eng Ying! 

 

Joseph shared with me regarding the SMT Newsletter, and I would love to be part of it! As the class will be split based on electives in Term 3, I was thinking of an article dedicating to F05 before we proceed to our new classes. However, I’m not sure if this topic would be possible. I could write about my Freshmore experience in general if you would prefer that as well. 

 

In addition, I saw the previous newsletter and noticed that some articles wrote from the 3rd POV while some used the Q&A method. Which kind of style should I be using? Apart from the 300 word limit, are there other restrictions like number of images and number of points I should be mentioning?

 

Thank you!

 

Yours sincerely,

 Chua

Hi Everyone,

 

I have created a shared folder HERE <https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsutdapac-my.sharepoint.com%2F%3Af%3A%2Fg%2Fpersonal%2Ftszwing_law_sutd_edu_sg%2FEjpMeJweoKZJlnzRd-GrfYYBuO86Yb4nroLkkO9_oeC6ZQ%3Fe%3DzZ9Qmw&data=04%7C01%7C_chua%40mymail.sutd.edu.sg%7Cd4a1926957ee40a38aef08d96f8fbd02%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637663485408497034%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=xrZHWXtQZBbRQ1Lzti76AhSnTHlQ%2Fdc7z8c%2B%2BvzsJeY%3D&reserved=0>  for me to share materials from Prof Arlindo (if any) with you, and for you to drop the Zoom Breakout Room recordings.

 

We would require assistance to record whenever the teams are in Breakout Rooms. The Zoom recordings do take a while to convert if the recording is too long, so a suggestion would be to stop the recording during your lunch/dinner breaks and resume recording during the discussions.

 

I will be recording the main Zoom room lectures, hence you are not required to record during those times.

 

Do feel free to let me know if there are any issues accessing the link, or if there are any questions. I must apologize that there has been some hiccups/last min changes today as we started Day 1 of this virtual programme.. I hope everyone is able to have fun and enjoy the rest of the programme in the next 3 days. 😊

Hello Vanya Jalan!



I hope you're doing well! I am , your Floor House Guardian for this 2 terms. I understand that you are currently abroad and not staying in the hostel at the moment because of air travel restriction measures.

 

No worries however! You can still get to know and connect with me and all the other residents on your floor (Blk 59 Level 05) by joining our Telegram Floor Chat at the link he https://t.me/joinchat/mBqHyfajjZhjNzFl <https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2Fjoinchat%2FmBqHyfajjZhjNzFl&data=04%7C01%7C_chua%40mymail.sutd.edu.sg%7C3ad17da2b4b74ca365ae08d9742091df%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637668505499413138%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=564T0T3%2F4eyFVh8rx5v48YdmWjwVByP4JUWRxzcnV7Y%3D&reserved=0> 




I would also need your help to complete this form by 17 Sep 2021: https://bit.ly/3DDDUeO <https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3DDDUeO&data=04%7C01%7C_chua%40mymail.sutd.edu.sg%7C3ad17da2b4b74ca365ae08d9742091df%7C3476b776e9904f72b95062489831623d%7C0%7C0%7C637668505499413138%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=yHUsFh%2Fm4qHE%2BhFNIPiHtpXPx7cpTKGQ4hItSoj39ww%3D&reserved=0> 

 

By the way, most of the residents on your floor will either be your classmates or peers from the next class, so getting to know them at the early start through the Floor Chat and hostel events would help you to settle into campus and academic life more quickly once you arrive in Singapore at a later date!

 

Do also tune in to the Residential Life briefing on 15 Sep (Wed) at 8pm as this is compulsory for all Freshmen:

Zoom URL: https://sutd-edu.zoom.us/j/99076072390 <https://sutd-edu.zoom.us/j/99076072390> 

Meeting ID: 990 7607 2390

Passcode: s?6AAq?e

 

And join us for the Freshies’ Virtual House Warming Floor Event on 15th September at about 8.45pm, once the Residential Life Briefing ends. I will send the details to the call closer to the date.

 

Freshies on our floor will get to know one another over snacks and drinks, so have some prepared for yourself too.




Looking forward to meeting you virtually soon on 15 Sep, and do keep a lookout (via the Floor Chat) for other exciting hostel events that are also lined up for Sep and Oct, like growing Microgreens indoors, ‘Favour A Neighbour’ (FAN) etc!

 

Should you have any questions, feel free to reach me via email or Telegram (@_chua), and please let me know once you have checked into the hostel so that I may meet you in person to pass you a Welcome Pack! 

 
Yours sincerely,







"

[Restricted] Seating Plan for Cohort 20F08,"Message Classification: Restricted

 

 

 Students,

Welcome back to SUTD!

A collaborative and cooperative culture is one of the key traits that keep the SUTD community spirit strong. 

Cohort-based learning

In our cohort-based pedagogy that emphasises peer learning, you will continue to be assigned randomly to groups and work with new people.

Seating Plan

Term 3 starts on 13 September (Monday) and we would like to provide information of your seat number and seating plan.  Please refer to the attached PDF.

As part of the safe management measures, please minimise your interactions by working with the assigned group of no more than 5 persons and occupying the assigned seat for lessons. Please refer to other measures shared in the attached email: Notice for Students (26 August 2021).

Some of your cohort/group mates may not be able to join you at the start of the term as they are serving SHN or entering Singapore later. As their buddies, you can:

*	Provide the Affected International Students (AIS) with opportunities of digital socialisation inside and outside classroom (e.g. 5th row) to instil a sense of belonging and camaraderie 
*	Provide the AIS with peer support in learning 
*	Highlight potential issues/challenges encountered in group projects, if any to course instructors.

 

Thank you.

 

Best regards,

Office of Student Administration

Hope that the first day of the term went well for all of you! 2 groups to be addressed here…

First, the Term 1 Freshmores and new Graduate residents! A warm welcome to SUTD residential life! We hope that you will feel right at home here and enjoy the hostel activities we have lined up for you. Next, the returning Freshmores (Term 3) and pillar-year students (Term 6)! Glad to have you back with us again!

From this term onwards, the House Guardians will be sending e-newsletters once every 2 months or so to keep you informed of hostel events and happenings. The newsletters will also contain snippets of information on interesting or good-to-know topics, like holiday festivals, recipes, mental health awareness etc.

The 1st edition is attached. In this email, we’ve also attached a poster summarising the Residential Life and Housing Teams here in SUTD. This poster highlights how both teams work closely together to make your hostel stay experience a pleasant and memorable one. Happy reading!

Also, if you have feedback on how we may improve our newsletters, or would like to contribute an anecdote/comic strip/memorable quote etc. with us, we would love to hear from you!
